# KrakenTrader
This project polls the Kraken-API-JAVA (https://github.com/nyg/kraken-api-java) to track the weekly minimums, maximums and the mooving averages
for Cryptocurrency prices on the Kraken Exchange. The algorithm alerts the user via E-mail if a currency pair's price falls below or above the weekly minima
and maxima, and indicates wether the user should buy or sell a certain pair. The program trades the alerted currency pairs on a fake $10000 initial balance
allowing you to monitor the algorithm's reliability.
